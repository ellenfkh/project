## Nick's Critique

It doesn't look like you did a project notebook this week. Sad face :(

From our chats in class and your preliminary evaluation though, I think I can give you a little bit of feedback. 
It sounds like you are making good progress
on your new language design (I'm looking forward to seeing what you have done!). From your preliminary eval, it sounds like
you are doing some really cool things with your new plans. I'm sorry that you feel that previous 
critiques have not been very helpful. Hopefully the last couple will be. Unfortunately this one won't really
be as I am having trouble getting aquainted with your current status of work. Regarding real-time querying though,
I get that it would be nice to make Prolog style queries, but I'm wondering if, for purposes of the demo, this 
should be a reach goal. As we are getting down to the end of it, perhaps it is time to start thinking about
stabalizing the feature set that you have.

Good luck!
