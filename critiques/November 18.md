First off, I like this project. It seems it could be a really useful way of
keeping track of relationships.

As for what you need to implement next, I completely agree with you. For now, I
would focus on getting the querying system up so you can ask the database for
results. After that, you can work on relationships. Definitely think about
adding in new relationships soon though, since that'll be the backbone of the
project.

As for who handles Child(Freddy, Fred) => Parent(Fred, Freddy), I would say that
this should be handled only by the interpreter. The parser should add the
relationships you explicitly specify only. After that, the interpreter can build
the graph and figure out the more complex relationships, like the one you
mentioned about a child of a child being a grandchild.

I wish I knew more about graph algorithms, but I would be there is a way to
handle this cleanly! Naively, you could do a pass through all possible relations
to determine whose child of a child is a grandchild, given any child
relationship, but there's probably a way better way to do this. If you could
make it a bidirectional graph where the direction dictates parent vs. child
relationship, that could be quite useful too. Not sure how feasible any of this
is though.

Queries I would want is asking relationships between two individuals, asking
"Who is the X of Fred?" where X is "Child", etc, and asking "What is Fred to
everyone else?" which would return all connections to Fred. You also could add
the inverse of both of these, "Who is Fred an X to?" or "What is everyone's
relationship to Fred?"
