Sorry this is a late critique! It looks like you made a lot of progress! 
I know that the last time we met with
critique groups in class it seemed like you had a lot of issues to resolve, but I 
think you have dealt with them for the most part. In response to the searching 
question - it seems like working with a library might be more complicated 
than it's worth unless you can find one that you think will work super well. 
A searching algorithm (like BFS) would not be too crazy to implement
yourself (I think). Especially if you have a limited amount of features
that you want to have in the final project. I think that since we are so close
to the end of the project a feature freeze would be a good idea. Good luck!
