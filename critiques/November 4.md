This project seems pretty cool.  I've definitely had trouble keeping complex
character relationships in my head while reading books/watching movies/
whatever, so I would find this useful.

It seems like there's a good balance between sheer programming and language
design.  The balance is a bit closer to sheer programming, it seems (as I see
it, most of your design is laid out in the plan, and doesn't need much more
work), but I think that's okay.

Do you plan on adding more complicated syntax/ the ability to specify more
complicated queries or relationships? It seems like that would be a good way to
spend more time on the design side of the project, if you were so inclined.

Have you thought at all about visualizing the trees?  That might be something
worth doing, and possibly not much extra work once you nail down the
intermediate representation.  You'd still have to track down a tree rendering
library, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of libraries for that.

Your design looks good so far.  Looking forward to seeing how it comes together!
