To answer your question, it seems to me like your IR is extensible. You have the basic building blocks pretty well-set. It
doesn't surprise me that the IR is not very rich, as it does not need to be. The code seems to be on the right track to me, so 
best of luck in the future stages. Sorry I don't have much to say.
